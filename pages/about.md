## About Special Collections

Special Collections at the Pratt Institute Libraries encompass a wide range of formats, content areas, and time periods. The primary mission of these collections is to support undergraduate and graduate teaching at the Institute and are comprised original and unique items that are too rare, fragile, or valuable to be included among the regular circulating collections. Actively collected formats that grow through a combination of collecting, gifts, and transfers from elsewhere in the collection include: printed books, periodicals, ephemera, folios of prints and photographs, pop-up books, artistsâ€™ books, zines, DVDs and Blu-Rays, streaming video, and digital images. The following formats are retained and preserved, but not actively collected: slides, picture files, 16mm films, and VHS tapes.
