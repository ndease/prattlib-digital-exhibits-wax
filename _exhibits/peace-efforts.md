There were a number of peace-related efforts that came out of Pratt in the late 60’s and early 70’s. The Vietnam War split the student body and the presence of an ROTC program furthered that divide. Civil Rights were also a part of the conversation as there were many parallels and overlaps between the two movements.

## Schedule of Events for International Student Strike

On April 26, 1968, Pratt students participated in an International Student Strike. The day included a number of speeches and activities that centered demanding an end to the war, racism, and the draft.

## Student Groups

A number of student groups formed that were related to the efforts to stop the war, including the Student Peace Union and the National Student Association. These groups organized events, released statements, and attempted to work with Pratt’s administration.
